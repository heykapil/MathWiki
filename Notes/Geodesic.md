title: Definition.

Let $X$ be a metric space. A <b>geodesic segment/ray/line</b> in $X$ is an isometric embedding of $\l[0,a\r]$, $\l[0,+\infty\r)$, or $\R$ into $X$, respectively.
* For $x,y\in X$, a <b>geodesic</b> from $x$ to $y$ is a geodesic segment $c:\l[0,a\r]\into X$ such that $c\l(0\r)=x$ and $c\l(a\r)=y$.
* A metric space is <b>geodesic</b> if any two $x,y\in X$ is joined by a geodesic.
* A subset $C\subseteq X$ is <b>convex</b> if $C$ is geodesic and the image of every $X$-geodesic between $x,y\in C$ is contained in $C$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Note that if $c:\l[0,a\r]\into X$ is a geodesic between $x$ and $y$, then $a=d\l(x,y\r)$. Such a geodesic may not be unique.
* If there is a unique geodesic between $x$ and $y$, we can denote it by $\l[x,y\r]$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
