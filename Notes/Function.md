title: Definition.

A binary relation $f$ is a <b>function</b> if for all $x\in\dom f$, there exists a unique $y$ such that $\tpl{x,y}\in f$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> If $f$ is a function with $\dom f=X$ and $\ran f\subseteq Y$ for some sets $X$ and $Y$, write $f:X\to Y$ and call $f$ a <b>function from $X$ into $Y$</b>. For all $x\in\dom f$, the unique $y\in\ran f$ such that $\tpl{x,y}\in f$ is denoted by $f\l(x\r)$ and we write $x\mapsto y$. The set of all functions from $X$ into $Y$ is denoted $Y^X$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> It is sometimes convenient to define a function as a triple $f\coloneqq\tpl{\Gamma_{\mathclap{f}}\ ,X,Y}$ where $\Gamma_{\mathclap{f}}\,$ is our original definition of a function, referred now as the <b>graph of $f$</b>. All notations above still apply, but since $\cdm f\coloneqq Y$ is now fixed, call it the <b>codomain of $f$</b>. This makes surjectivity a property of the function $f$ itself, and, more importantly, makes functions morphisms of the category $\catset$ (our original definition violates $\axicat[3]$). If we write $f:X\to Y$, then this definition is implied.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
