title: Definition.

Let $S\subseteq G$ be a subset of a group $G$. The <b>subgroup generated by $S$</b> is the image $\gen{S}\coloneqq\im\l(F\l(S\r)\to G\r)$ of the unique group homomorphism extending $S\into G$.
* If $G=\gen{S}$, then $G$ is said to be <b>generated by $S$</b>. If furthermore $S$ is finite, then $M$ is said to be <b>finitely-generated</b>.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Equivalently, $\gen{S}$ is the subgroup consisting of all $g\in G$ that can be expressed as a (finite) product of elements in $S$ and their inverses.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> Note that a group $G$ is finitely-generated iff there is a surjection $F\l(\l\{0,\dots,n\r\}\r)\onto G$ for some $n\in\N$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
