``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

Let $S\subseteq G$ be a subset of a group $G$. The <b>subgroup generated by $S$</b> is the image $\gen{S}\coloneqq\im\l(F\l(S\r)\to G\r)$ of the unique homomorphism extending $S\into G$.
* If $\gen{S}=G$, then $G$ is said to be <b>generated by $S$</b>.
* If $S$ is finite, then $\gen{S}$ is said to be <b>finitely-generated</b>.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Equivalently, $\gen{S}\coloneqq\l\{g\in G\st\ex s_i\in S\land\ex\epsilon_i=\pm1:g=s_1^{\epsilon_1}\cdots s_n^{\epsilon_n}\r\}$ contains all elements $g\in G$ that can be expressed as a (finite) product of elements in $S$ and their inverses. Alternatively, we can also let $\gen{S}\coloneqq\bigcap\l\{H\leq G\st S\subseteq H\r\}$. If $S=\l\{s_1,\dots,s_n\r\}$, we write $\gen{s_1,\dots,s_n}\coloneqq\gen{S}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> Note that a group $G$ is finitely-generated iff there is a surjection $F\l(\l\{0,\dots,n\r\}\r)\onto G$ for some $n\in\N$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
