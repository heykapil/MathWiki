title: Definition.

Let $K$ be a field and consider an indexed subset $U\coloneqq\l\{u_i\r\}_{i\in I}\subseteq V$ of a $K$-vector space $V$. A vector $v\in V$ is said to be a <b>$K$-linear combination of vectors in $U$</b> if for all $i\in I$, there exists $\alpha_i\in K$ such that $v=\sum_{i\in I}\alpha_iu_i$ where $\alpha_i=0$ for all but finitely-many $i\in I$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Note that we intensionally exclude infinite sums since bare vector spaces have no notion of convergence (if $U$ is uncountable, not even a series can be written). Indeed, we may rephrase this definition by saying that $v$ is a $K$-linear combination of vectors in $U$ if
$$\begin{equation}
    \ex n\in\N,\fa i\in\l\{1,\dots,n\r\},\ex\alpha_i\in K,\ex u_i\in U:v=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\alpha_iu_i.
\end{equation}$$
Redefining $I=\l\{1,\dots,n\r\}$, we see that $I$ carries an order structure and hence we may say that $v$ is a <b>$K$-linear combination of the sequence $\tpl{u_i}_{i\in I}$ with coefficients $\tpl{\alpha_i}_{i\in I}$</b>.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> Here, we consider $U$ as an indexed subset of $V$ for convenience; the indexing structure is not needed so we may talk about linear combinations of vectors in sub<i>sets</i> of $V$. However, if $I$ carries an order structure (say $I=\l\{1,\dots,n\r\}$ for some $n\in\N$ or $I=\N$ itself), we may identify $\l\{u_i\r\}_{i\in I}$ with the $I$-tuple $\tpl{u_i}_{i\in I}$ which allows us to talk about ordered bases, which _is_ important.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> If each $\alpha_i=0$, then $v$ is said to be the <b>trivial linear combination of vectors in $U$</b>.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
