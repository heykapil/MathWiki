title: Definition.

Let $X$ be a set. A <b>$\sigma$-algebra</b> on $X$ is a collection $\mc{B}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ containing $\em$ and is closed under complements and countable unions.
* A <b>measure</b> on $\tpl{X,\mc{B}}$ is a map $\mu:\mc{B}\to\l[0,\infty\r]$ sending $\em\mapsto0$ and is countably additive, i.e., $\mu\l(\bigsqcup_nS_n\r)=\sum_n\mu\l(S_n\r)$ for all pairwise disjoint sets $S_n\in\mc{B}$.

The pair $\tpl{X,\mc{B}}$ is called a <b>measurable space</b>, and the triple $\tpl{X,\mc{B},\mu}$ a <b>measure space</b>.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Measures are often first defined on a smaller collection $\mc{A}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ containing $\em$, called an <i>algebra</i> on $X$, where we require only require that it is closed under complements and <i>finite</i> unions. Those measures $\mu:\mc{A}\to\l[0,\infty\r]$ are then called <i>premeasures</i> instead. Note that countable additivity is still required for $\mu$ to be a premeasure, only that we have an additional hypothesis that $\bigsqcup_nA_n\in\mc{A}$ in the first place.
* A (pre)measure is said to be <i>finite</i> if $\mu\l(X\r)<\infty$, <i>probability</i> if $\mu\l(X\r)=1$, <i>$\sigma$-finite</i> if there is a partition $X=\bigsqcup_nX_n$ such that $\mu\l(X_n\r)<\infty$ for all $n\in\N$, and <i>atomless</i> if there are no sets $A\subseteq X$, called <i>atoms</i>, such that $B\subseteq A$ implies either $\mu\l(B\r)=0$ or $\mu\l(B\r)=\mu\l(A\r)$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> A related notion of a measure is that of an <i>outer measure</i>, which is defined on the entire $\pow\l(X\r)$. Indeed, for any collection $\mc{A}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ containing $\em$ and covering $X$ and any function $\mu:\mc{A}\to\l[0,\infty\r]$, the <i>outer measure</i> induced by $\mu$ is the map $\mu^\ast:\pow\l(X\r)\to\l[0,\infty\r]$ defined by
$$\begin{equation}
    \mu^\ast\!\l(S\r)\coloneqq\inf\l\{\sum_n\mu\l(A_n\r)\st\l\{A_n\r\}_n\subseteq\mc{A}\textrm{ and }A\subseteq\bigcup_nA_n\r\}.
\end{equation}$$
Let $\tpl{X,\mc{B},\mu}$ be a measure space. A subset $Z\subseteq X$ is said to be <i>$\mu$-null</i> if there is some $\hat{Z}\in\mc{B}$ containing $Z$ with $\mu\,(\hat{Z})=0$. Note that if $\mu^\ast\!\l(Z\r)=0$, then $Z$ is $\mu$-null.
* Indeed, since $\mu^\ast\!\l(Z\r)=0$, for every $m>0$ there is some cover $Z\subseteq\bigcup_nB^m_n$ with each $B^m_n\in\mc{B}$ such that $\sum_n\mu\l(B^m_n\r)<1/m$. Set $\widehat{Z}\coloneqq\bigcap_{m>0}\bigcup_nB^m_n\in\mc{B}$. Then $\widehat{Z}\subseteq\bigcup_nB^m_n$ for every $m>0$, so by monotonicity and countable subadditivity we have $\mu^\ast(\widehat{Z})\leq\mu^\ast\!\l(\bigcup_nB^m_n\r)\leq\sum_n\mu^\ast\!\l(B^m_n\r)<1/m$ for every $m>0$. Thus $\mu^\ast(\widehat{Z})=0$, and since $Z\subseteq\bigcup_nB^m_n$ for every $m$, we see that $Z\subseteq\widehat{Z}$ too.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span> ^null-set-outer-measure

<b>Remark.</b> For any collection $\mc{C}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$, the <i>($\sigma$-)algebra generated by $\mc{C}$</i> is the intersection of all ($\sigma$-)algebras on $X$ containing $\mc{C}$, denoted respectively by $\gen{\mc{C}}$ and $\gen{\mc{C}}_\sigma$. A more bottom-up approach is by setting $\gen{\mc{C}}\coloneqq\bigcup_n\mc{C}_n$, where $\mc{C}_0\coloneqq\mc{C}$ and $\mc{C}_{n+1}$ is the collection of all complements and finite unions of elements from $\mc{C}_n$. Similarly, $\gen{\mc{C}}_\sigma=\bigcup_{\alpha\in\omega_1}\mc{C}_\alpha$ where $\mc{C}_0\coloneqq\mc{C}$ and $\mc{C}_\alpha$ is the collection of all complements and countable unions of elements from $\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha}\mc{C}_\beta$.
* If $\mc{A}_i$ for $i=1,\dots,d$ are algebras on $X_i$, the <i>product $\sigma$-algebra</i> $\bigotimes_{i=1}^d\mc{A}_i$ is the $\sigma$-algebra on $\prod_{i=1}^dX_i$ generated by all sets of the form $\prod_{i=1}^dA_i$ for $A_i\in\mc{A}_i$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
