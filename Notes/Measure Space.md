title: Definition.

Let $X$ be a set. A <b>$\sigma$-algebra</b> on $X$ is a collection $\mc{B}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ containing $\em$ and is closed under complements and countable unions.
* A <b>measure</b> on $\tpl{X,\mc{B}}$ is a map $\mu:\mc{B}\to\l[0,\infty\r]$ sending $\em\mapsto0$ and is countably additive, i.e., $\mu\l(\bigsqcup_nB_n\r)=\sum_n\mu\l(B_n\r)$ for all pairwise disjoint sets $B_n\in\mc{B}$.
* A set $M\subseteq X$ is <b>$\mu$-measurable</b> if $M=B\cup Z$ for some $B\in\mc{B}$ and <b>$\mu$-null</b> set $Z$, i.e. a set $Z\subseteq X$ such that there exists $\hat{Z}\in\mc{B}$ containing $Z$ with $\mu\,(\hat{Z})=0$.

The pair $\tpl{X,\mc{B}}$ is called a <b>measurable space</b>, and the triple $\tpl{X,\mc{B},\mu}$ a <b>measure space</b>. The collection of all $\mu$-measurable sets is denoted by $\Meas_\mu$.

<b>Remark.</b> Measures are often first defined on a smaller collection $\mc{A}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ containing $\em$, called an <i>algebra</i> on $X$, where we require only require that it is closed under complements and <i>finite</i> unions. Those measures $\mu_0:\mc{A}\to\l[0,\infty\r]$ are then called <i>premeasures</i> instead (countable additivity is still required, only that we need the extra assumption that $\bigsqcup_nA_n\in\mc{A}$ in the first place). After some definitions, we outline the hierarchy and relations between the measures.
* A (pre)measure is said to be <i>finite</i> if $\mu\l(X\r)<\infty$, <i>probability</i> if $\mu\l(X\r)=1$, <i>$\sigma$-finite</i> if there is a partition $X=\bigsqcup_nX_n$ such that $\mu\l(X_n\r)<\infty$ for all $n\in\N$, and <i>atomless</i> if there are no sets $A\subseteq X$, called <i>atoms</i>, such that $B\subseteq A$ implies either $\mu\l(B\r)=0$ or $\mu\l(B\r)=\mu\l(A\r)$.
* For any collection $\mc{C}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$, the <i>($\sigma$-)algebra generated by $\mc{C}$</i> is the intersection of all ($\sigma$-)algebras on $X$ containing $\mc{C}$, denoted respectively by $\gen{\mc{C}}$ and $\gen{\mc{C}}_\sigma$. A more bottom-up approach is by setting $\gen{\mc{C}}\coloneqq\bigcup_n\mc{C}_n$, where $\mc{C}_0\coloneqq\mc{C}$ and $\mc{C}_{n+1}$ is the collection of all complements and finite unions of elements from $\mc{C}_n$. Similarly, $\gen{\mc{C}}_\sigma=\bigcup_{\alpha\in\omega_1}\mc{C}_\alpha$ where $\mc{C}_0\coloneqq\mc{C}$ and $\mc{C}_\alpha$ is the collection of all complements and countable unions of elements from $\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha}\mc{C}_\beta$.

Given a $\sigma$-finite premeasure $\mu_0$ on $\mc{A}$, we can extend $\mu_0$ via CarathÃ©odory to a unique measure $\mu$ on $\gen{\mc{A}}_\sigma$. The extension is done by restricting the <i>outer measure</i> $\mu_0^\ast$ induced by $\mu_0$, which is defined on $\pow\l(X\r)$ and maps $S\mapsto\inf\l\{\sum_n\mu_0\!\l(A_n\r)\st A_n\in\mc{A},A\subseteq\bigcup_nA_n\r\}$, to a measure on the $\sigma$-algebra $\mc{B}\coloneqq\bar{\mc{A}}$ where the closure is taken in the pseudo-metric $d\l(B_1,B_2\r)\coloneqq\mu_0^\ast\!\l(B_1\symdiff B_2\r)$. The restriction $\l.\mu_0^\ast\r|_\mc{B}$ further restricts down to the desired measure $\mu$ on $\gen{\mc{A}}_\sigma$, and it can be shown that in the measure space $\tpl{X,\gen{\mc{A}}_\sigma,\mu}$, the $\mu$-measurable sets $\Meas_\mu$ is precisely $\mc{B}$.
* If one already has a measure $\mu$ on $\gen{\mc{A}}_\sigma$, then one defines the <i>completion</i> $\bar{\mu}$ of $\mu$ to the $\sigma$-algebra $\Meas_\mu$ by letting $\bar{\mu}\l(B\cup Z\r)\coloneqq\mu\l(B\r)$. This is well-defined and is the only extension of $\mu$ to $\Meas_\mu$, so we may w.l.o.g. assume that $\mu$ is <i>complete</i>. Furthermore, we have $\bar{\mu}=\l.\mu_0^\ast\r|_\mc{B}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
