title: Definition.

Let $\tpl{X,\leq}$ be a poset and fix $S\subseteq X$. The <b>infimum of $S$ in $X$</b> is a lower bound $l$ of $S$ in $X$ such that $l'\leq l$ for all lower bounds $l'$ of $S$ in $X$.
* Similarly, the <b>supremum of $S$ in $X$</b> is an upper bound $u$ of $S$ in $X$ such that $u\leq u'$ for all upper bounds $u'$ of $S$ in $X$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> If $l$ is the infimum of $S$, write $\inf S\coloneqq l$. Similarly, if $u$ is the supremum of $S$, write $\sup S\coloneqq u$. In the context of lattice theory, the infimum is also called the <b>meet of $S$</b>, denoted by $\bigwedge S$, and the supremum is also called the <b>join of $S$</b>, denoted by $\bigvee S$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
