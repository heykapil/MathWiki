title: Definition.

A topological space $X$ is said to be <b>path-connected</b> if for all $x_0,x_1\in X$, there exists a path $\gamma:x_0\pathto x_1$.
* We say that $X$ is <b>locally path-connected</b> if for all $x\in X$ and all neighborhoods $U$ of $x$, there exists a path-connected neighborhood $V\subseteq U$ of $x$.
