``` ad-Theorem
title: Theorem (Omitting Types Theorem).

Let $T$ be a complete $\mc{L}$-theory over a countable language $\mc{L}$ and let $p(\vec{x})$ be an $n$-type of $T$. There is a model $\mc{M}\models T$ omitting $p$ iff $p$ is non-isolated.

```

<i>Proof.</i> If $p$ is isolated by $\phi(\vec{x})$, then $T\cup\l\{\ex x\phi(x)\r\}$ is satisfiable and hence $\ex x\phi(x)\in T$ by completeness. Thus any $\mc{M}\models T$ realizes $p$. Conversely, if $p$ is non-isolated, we proceed
