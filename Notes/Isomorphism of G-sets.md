title: Definition.

Let $G$ be a group acting on sets $X$ and $Y$. We say that $X$ and $Y$ are <b>isomorphic as $G$-sets</b> if there exists an invertible $G$-equivariant map $f:X\to Y$, called a <b>$G$-isomorphism</b>.

```

<b>Remark.</b> That is, $G$-isomorphisms are isomorphisms in $\catgset$. Since ‘is isomorphic to’ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $X\iso Y$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
