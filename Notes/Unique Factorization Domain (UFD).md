title: Definition.

Let $R$ be an integral domain. We say that $R$ is a <b>factorization domain</b> if every non-zero non-unit element $r\in R$ admits a factorization $r=\prod_{i=1}^{n}a_i$ into irreducibles $a_i\in R$. If such a factorization is unique up to associates and a permutation, we say that $R$ is a <b>unique factorization domain (UFD)</b>.
