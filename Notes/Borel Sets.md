title: Definition.

Let $X$ be a topological space. The <b>Borel $\sigma$-algebra</b> on $X$ is the $\sigma$-algebra $\mc{B}\l(X\r)$ generated by the topology of $X$, whose elements are called <b>Borel sets</b>.

<b>Remark.</b> A subset $A\subseteq X$ is said to be $G_\delta$ if it is a countable intersection of open sets, and dually for $F_\sigma$. They form the first stages of the <i>Borel Hierarchy</i>.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> If $\mc{U}$ is a countable basis for $X$, then $\mc{B}\l(X\r)=\gen{\mc{U}}_\sigma$. Indeed, that $\gen{\mc{U}}_\sigma\subseteq\mc{B}\l(X\r)$ is trivial. Conversely, every open set $U\subseteq X$ can be written as $U=\bigcup_nU_n$ with each $U_n\in\mc{U}$, so $\gen{\mc{U}}_\sigma$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing the open sets. Thus $\mc{B}\l(X\r)\subseteq\gen{\mc{U}}_\sigma$, as desired.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
