title: Definition.

A <b>ring</b> is a triple $\tpl{R,+,\cdot}$ where $\tpl{R,+}$ is an abelian group, $\tpl{R,\cdot}$ is a monoid, and where $\cdot$ distributes over $+$ on both sides.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Every ring $R$ is a left module over itself by multiplication.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

---

<b>Remark.</b> Some authors do not require $\tpl{R,\cdot}$ to be a monoid, only that it is a semigroup. That is, $R$ is not required to have a multiplicative identity.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
