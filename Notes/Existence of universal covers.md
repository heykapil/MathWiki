title: Proposition.

Let $X$ be a path-connected and locally path-connected space. Then $X$ admits a universal cover $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$ iff $X$ is semilocally simply-connected.

```

<i>Proof.</i> The forward direction is easy since for every $x\in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ lifting to a sheet $\widetilde{U}$ that projects homeomorphically only $U$. Every loop $\gamma$ in $U$ then lifts to a loop in $\widetilde{U}$, which is null-homotopic in $\widetilde{X}$ since $\widetilde{X}$ is simply-connected. Projecting the homotopy shows that $\gamma$ is null-homotopic in $X$, so the map $\iota_\ast$ induced by $\iota$ is trivial in $\pi_1\l(X,x_0\r)$.

Conversely, let $X$ be a semilocally simply-connected space and fix $x_0\in X$. Define $\widetilde{X}\coloneqq\l\{\gamma:I\to X\st\gamma\l(0\r)=x_0\r\}$ and consider the map $p:\widetilde{X}\to X:\gamma\mapsto\gamma\l(1\r)$, which is well-defined since path-homotopies fix endpoints. We make $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$ a covering map by topologizing $\widetilde{X}$ as follows.
1. Let $\mc{B}$ be the collection of all path-connected subsets $U\subseteq X$ such that $\iota_\ast:\pi_1\l(U\r)\into\pi_1\l(X\r)$ is trivial, which we claim is a basis for a topology on $X$. Since $X$ is semilocally simply-connected, $\mc{B}$ covers $X$. If $U_1,U_2\in\mc{B}$ and $x\in U_1\cap U_2$, then there is an path-connected neighborhood $V\subseteq U_1\cap U_2$ of $x$ such that the inclusion $V\into X$ factors as $V\into U_i\into X$ and induce inclusions $\pi_1\l(V\r)\into\pi_1\l(U_i\r)\into\pi_1\l(X\r)$, the latter being trivial. Thus the inclusion $\iota_\ast:\pi_1\l(V\r)\into\pi_1\l(X\r)$ is trivial.
2. For a fixed $U\in\mc{B}$ and a path $\gamma:I\to X$ starting at $x_0$ and ending in $U$, let $\widetilde{U}_\gamma\coloneqq\{\gamma\ast\delta\in\widetilde{X}\,|\,\delta:I\to U,\delta\l(0\r)=\gamma\l(1\r)\}$. Since $U$ is path-connected, every $x\in U$ admits a path $\delta:\gamma\l(1\r)\pathto x$ in $U$, so $\l.p\r|_{\widetilde{U}_\gamma}\!:\widetilde{U}_\gamma\to U$ is surjective. For injectivity, note that if $\delta_1,\delta_2:\gamma\l(1\r)\pathto x$ are two paths in $U$ with the same-endpoint $x$, then $\delta_1\ast\delta_2^-$ is a loop in $U$ that null-homotopes in $X$ to the constant path at $\gamma\l(1\r)$. Thus $\delta_1\htopeq\delta_2$, so $\gamma\ast\delta_1\htopeq\gamma\ast\delta_2$.
3. For all $U\in\mc{B}$ and all paths $\gamma,\gamma':I\to X$ starting at $x_0$ and ending in $U$, we claim that $\gamma'\in\widetilde{U}_\gamma$ implies that $\widetilde{U}_\gamma=\widetilde{U}_{\gamma'}$. Indeed, we have $\gamma'\htopeq\gamma\ast\delta$ for some path $\delta:I\to U$ compatible with $\gamma$. Thus any $\eta\in\widetilde{U}_{\gamma'}$ is of the form $\gamma\ast\delta\ast\delta'$ for some path $\delta':I\to U$ compatible with $\delta$ and hence $\eta\in\widetilde{U}_\gamma$. Conversely, any $\eta\in\widetilde{U}_\gamma$ is of the form $\gamma\ast\delta''$ for some path $\delta'':I\to U$ compatible with $\gamma$, and since $\gamma\ast\delta''\htopeq\gamma\ast\delta\ast\delta^-\ast\delta''\htopeq\gamma'\ast\delta^-\ast\delta''$, we see that $\eta\in\widetilde{U}_{\gamma'}$ too.
4. We claim that the collection $\widetilde{\mc{B}}$ of all sets $\widetilde{U}_\gamma$ is a basis for a topology on $\widetilde{X}$. It is clear that $\widetilde{\mc{B}}$ covers $\widetilde{X}$ since if $\gamma\in\widetilde{X}$, then $\gamma\l(1\r)\in U$ for some $U\in\mc{B}$ and is thus contained in the subset $\widetilde{U}_\gamma\subseteq\widetilde{X}$ defined by $\gamma$. Furthermore, for all $\widetilde{V}_\sigma,\widetilde{W}_\rho\in\widetilde{\mc{B}}$ and $\gamma\in\widetilde{V}_\sigma\cap\widetilde{W}_\rho$, let $U\subseteq V\cap W$ contain $p\l(\gamma\r)$. Then $\widetilde{V}_\gamma=\widetilde{V}_\sigma$ and $\widetilde{W}_\gamma=\widetilde{W}_\rho$ by the above, so $\widetilde{U}_\gamma$ contains $\gamma$ and is a subset of $\widetilde{V}_\gamma\cap\widetilde{W}_\gamma=\widetilde{V}_\sigma\cap\widetilde{W}_\rho$, as desired.
5. Equipping $\widetilde{X}$ with the topology generated by $\widetilde{\mc{B}}$ makes $p$ continuous. Furthermore, for each $x\in X$ there exists some $U\in\mc{B}$ such that $p^{-1}\!\l(U\r)$ is partitioned by the sets $\{\widetilde{U}_\gamma\}_\gamma$ ranging over all $\gamma:I\to X$ starting at $x_0$ and ending in $U$. Indeed, if $\gamma\in\widetilde{U}_\sigma\cap\widetilde{U}_\rho$, then $\widetilde{U}_\gamma=\widetilde{U}_\sigma=\widetilde{U}_\rho$. Lastly, each $\l.p\r|_{\widetilde{U}_\gamma}\!:\widetilde{U}_\gamma\to U$ is open since for all open subsets $\widetilde{V}_\sigma\subseteq\widetilde{U}_\gamma$, the image $p\,(\widetilde{V}_\sigma)=V$ is open.
6. Finally, we show that $\widetilde{X}$ is path-connected by taking $\gamma\in\widetilde{X}$ and considering the homotopy $\gamma_t:I\to X$ coinciding with $\gamma$ on $\l[0,t\r]$ and constant at $\gamma\l(t\r)$ on $\l[t,1\r]$. Letting $\widetilde{x}_0\in\widetilde{X}$ denote the homotopy class of the constant path at $x_0$, we see that $\widetilde{\gamma}:t\mapsto\gamma_t$ is a path in $\widetilde{X}$ starting at $\widetilde{x}_0$ and ending at $\gamma$, as desired.

It remains to show that $\widetilde{X}$ is simply-connected, and to this end, since $p_\ast:\pi_1(\widetilde{X},\widetilde{x}_0)\into\pi_1\!\l(X,x_0\r)$, it suffices to show that $p_\ast\pi_1(\widetilde{X},\widetilde{x}_0)$ is trivial. Take $\gamma\in p_\ast\pi_1(\widetilde{X},\widetilde{x}_0)$ and note that $\l(p\circ\widetilde{\gamma}\r)\l(t\r)=p\l(\gamma_t\r)=\gamma_t\!\l(t\r)=\gamma\l(t\r)$, so $\widetilde{\gamma}$ is the lift of $\gamma$ to $\widetilde{X}$ starting that $\widetilde{x}_0$. But $p_\ast\pi_1(\widetilde{X},\widetilde{x}_0)$ consist of loops in $X$ at $x_0$ whose lifts are loops at $\widetilde{x}_0$, so the lift $\widetilde{\gamma}$ constructed above is a loop at $\widetilde{x}_0$. Hence $\gamma=\widetilde{x}_0$ is the constant path at $x_0$, as desired.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
