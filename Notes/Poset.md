title: Definition.

Let $X$ be a set and $\leq$ be a partial order on $X$. The pair $\tpl{X,\leq}$ is called a <b>partially ordered set</b> or a <b>poset</b>.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Note that the pair $\tpl{X,<}$ is also called a poset; one can be constructed from the other.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
