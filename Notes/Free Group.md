title: Definition.

Let $X$ be a set. A <b>free group on $X$</b> is a group $F\l(X\r)$ equipped with a function $j:X\to F\l(X\r)$ such that for any group $G$ and function $f:X\to G$, there exists a unique group homomorphism $\phi:F\l(X\r)\to G$ such that $f=\phi\circ j$.

A group $G$ is said to be <b>free</b> if there is some set $A$ such that $G=F\l(A\r)$, in which case $A$ is a <b>free basis for $G$</b> and $\l|A\r|$ is called the <b>rank of $G$</b>.
