$\huge\rm\bf{G}\normalsize\rm\bf{ROUP THEORY}$ is the study of the [category of groups](obsidian://open?file=TODO); that is, the study of [groups](Group.md) and [homomorphisms](Group%20Homomorphism.md) between them.

<b>Constructions.</b> As with most categories, $\catgrp$ has [subobjects](Subgroup.md), [products](Direct%20Product%20(group).md), [direct sums](obsidian://open?file=TODO), and [quotients](Quotient%20Group.md). Unique to Group Theory is the concept of a [normal subgroup](Normal%20Subgroup.md) $N\nsubgrpeq G$, defined as subgroups that are [stable](Characterizations%20of%20normality.md) under [conjugation](Conjugation%20Action.md). These are precisely the subgroups that furnishes a compatible group structure on its quotient.

Similarly, as with most categories, we can define the [kernel](Kernel%20(Group%20Theory).md) and the image of a [homomorphism](Group%20Homomorphism.md) $\phi:G\to H$. Furthermore, $\ker\phi\nsubgrpeq G$, so $\phi$ [decomposes](Fundamental%20Theorem%20of%20Group%20Homomorphisms.md) into
![[Images/2023-01-03_225322/image.svg|300]]

which, in particular, implies the [Isomorphism Theorems](Isomorphism%20Theorems.md).<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Characterizations.</b> As with most categories, groups are identified up to [isomorphism](Group%20Isomorphism.md). A crude estimate is given by [Cayley’s Theorem](Cayley's%20Theorem.md), which states that every group is isomorphic to a [permutation group](Symmetric%20Group.md). However, permutation groups are very rich, so we restrict to [cyclic](Cyclic%20Group.md) or [Abelian](Abelian%20Group.md) groups.
* The [Fundamental Theorem of Finite abelian Groups](obsidian://open?file=TODO) states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime-power order.
* In turn, every cyclic group [is isomorphic to](Basic%20properties%20of%20cyclic%20groups.md) to either $\Z$ or $\Z_n\coloneqq\Z/n\Z$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Computations.</b> Courtesy of the Fundamental Theorem, most computations in abelian groups boil down to arithmetic in $\Z$ or $\Z_n$. Indeed, the former [is a EUD](Ring%20of%20integers%20is%20a%20EUD.md) and the latter [is a field $\Leftrightarrow$ $n$ is prime](Integers%20mod%20n%20is%20a%20field%20iff%20n%20prime.md), so their arithmetic is particularly simple.
* Furthermore, [$\Z_n$ is generated by](Basic%20properties%20of%20cyclic%20groups.md) any element $\l[m\r]\in\Z_n$ such that $m\perp n$, and [it decomposes into](Basic%20properties%20of%20cyclic%20groups.md) $\Z_k\times\Z_l$ if $k\perp l$ and $m=kl$. It also has a ring structure from which one obtains its [group of units](Multiplicative%20Group%20of%20Integers%20mod%20n.md), [Euler’s Totient Function](Euler's%20Totient%20Function.md), and their connection via [Euler’s Theorem](Euler's%20Theorem.md).
* The [order](Order.md) of a group element $g\in G$, defined as the smallest $n\in\N^+$ such that $g^n=e$, allows us to compute generating elements for cyclic groups. Indeed, for the [cyclic subgroup](Generating%20Set%20(Group).md) $\gen{g}\subseteq G$, we have that [$\ord{g}=\ord{\gen{g}}$](Basic%20properties%20of%20order.md).

For finite groups, one may use [Lagrange’s Theorem](Lagrange's%20Theorem.md) to calculate the [index](Index.md) of a subgroup $H\subseteq G$, defined as the number of left/right [cosets](Coset.md) of $H$ in $G$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
