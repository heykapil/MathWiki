title: Definition.

Let $V$ be a $K$-vector space. The <b>endomorphism algebra over $V$</b> is the unital associative algebra $\End\l(V\r)$ under composition.

```

<b>Remark.</b> From the links above, we see that $\End\l(V\r)$ is a $K$-vector space with the component-wise addition and scalar-multiplication, and that the composition
$$\begin{equation}
    \circ:\End\l(V\r)\times\End\l(V\r)\to\End\l(V\r)
\end{equation}$$
is a unital and associative binary operation that distributes over $+$ and is compatible with $\cdot$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
