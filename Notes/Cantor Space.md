title: Example.

The <b>Cantor space</b> is the product space $2^\omega$ with $2\coloneqq\l\{0,1\r\}$ equipped with the discrete topology.
* It is completely-metrizable with metric $d\l(x,y\r)\coloneqq1/2^{n\l(x,y\r)}$, where $n\l(x,y\r)$ is the first index for which $x_n\neq y_n$.
* It is separable with a countably dense subset $Q\coloneqq\l\{w0^\omega\st w\in 2^{<\omega}\r\}$, where $0^\omega\coloneqq\tpl{0,0,\dots}$, hence Polish.
* It is sequentially-compact, hence compact.

```

<b>Remark.</b> More generally, let $A$ be a countable set of <i>alphabets</i>. With $A^\omega$ defined similarly, the same proof shows that it is completely-metrizable and separable, hence Polish. If $A$ is finite, then it is also sequentially-compact, hence compact.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<i>Proof (metrizable).</i> That $d$ is positive-definite and symmetric are clear. For the triangle inequality, let $x,y,z\in 2^\omega$ be distinct. Set $i_0\coloneqq\min\l\{n\l(x,y\r),n\l(y,z\r)\r\}$ and observe that $x_i=y_i=z_i$ for all $i<i_0$, so $n\l(x,z\r)\geq i_0$. Thus $d\l(x,z\r)=1/2^{n\l(x,z\r)}\leq1/2^{i_0}=\max\l\{d\l(x,y\r),d\l(y,z\r)\r\}$, as desired.
* The basic open sets of the discrete space $2$ are $\l\{a\r\}$ where $a\in2$, so the basic open sets of the product space $2^\omega$ are <i>cylinders</i> $\l[w\r]\coloneqq\l\{x\in 2^\omega\st\l.x\r|_n=w\r\}$ where $\l.x\r|_n$ denotes the first $n$ components of $x$ and $w\in2^n$ is a finite word. These are precisely the open balls generated by $d$, so $2^\omega$ is metrizable.
* To show that $d$ is complete, let $\tpl{x_n}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $2^\omega$.
