title: Example.

The <b>Cantor space</b> is the product space $2^\N$ with $2\coloneqq\l\{0,1\r\}$ equipped with the discrete topology.
* It is completely-metrizable with metric $d\l(x,y\r)\coloneqq1/2^{\delta\l(x,y\r)}$, where $\delta\l(x,y\r)$ is the first index for which $x_n\neq y_n$.
* It is separable with a countably dense subset $Q\coloneqq\l\{w0^\infty\st w\in 2^{<\N}\r\}$, where $0^\infty\coloneqq\tpl{0,0,\dots}$, hence Polish.
* It is sequentially-compact, hence compact.

```

<b>Remark.</b> More generally, let $A$ be a countable set of <i>alphabets</i>. With $A^\N$ defined similarly, the same proof shows that it is completely-metrizable and separable, hence Polish. If $A$ is finite, then it is also sequentially-compact, hence compact.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<i>Proof (metrizable).</i> That $d$ is positive-definite and symmetric are clear. For the triangle inequality, let $x,y,z\in 2^\N$ be distinct. Set $i_0\coloneqq\min\l\{\delta\l(x,y\r),\delta\l(y,z\r)\r\}$ and observe that $x_i=y_i=z_i$ for all $i<i_0$, so $\delta\l(x,z\r)\geq i_0$. Thus $d\l(x,z\r)=1/2^{\delta\l(x,z\r)}\leq1/2^{i_0}=\max\l\{d\l(x,y\r),d\l(y,z\r)\r\}$, as desired.
* The basic open sets of the discrete space $2$ are $\l\{a\r\}$ where $a\in2$, so the basic open sets of the product space $2^\N$ are <i>cylinders</i> $\l[w\r]\coloneqq\l\{x\in 2^\N\st\l.x\r|_n=w\r\}$ where $\l.x\r|_n$ denotes the first $n$ components of $x$ and $w\in2^n$ is a finite word. These are precisely the open balls generated by $d$, so $2^\N$ is metrizable.
* To show that $d$ is complete, let $\tpl{x^n}_{n\in\N}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $2^\N$. For all $i\in\N$, there are large enough $n,m\in\N$ such that $d\l(x^n,x^m\r)<1/2^i$, so $\delta\l(x^n,x^m\r)>i$. This holds for all large enough $n\in\N$, so consider the sequence $l\in2^\N$ defined by $l_i\coloneqq x^n_i$ for any such sequence $x^n$. Take $\epsilon>0$ and choose $i\in\N$ large enough so $1/2^i<\epsilon$, so for some large enough $n\in\N$, we have $l_j=x^n_j$ for all $j\leq i$. Thus $\delta\l(x^n,l\r)>i$, so $d\l(x^n,l\r)=1/2^{\delta\l(x^n,l\r)}<1/2^i<\epsilon$, so $x^n\to l$ as desired.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>

<i>Proof (separable).</i> The subset $Q\coloneqq\l\{w0^\infty\in2^\N\st w\in2^{<\N}\r\}$ is dense in $2^\N$ since for any cylinder $\l[w\r]$, the intersection $\l[w\r]\cap Q=\l\{w00\dots\r\}$ is not empty.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
