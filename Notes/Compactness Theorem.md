``` ad-Theorem
title: Theorem (Compactness Theorem; Gödel 1930 & Maltsev 1936).

Let $\sigma$ be a signature in $\FOL$. If a $\sigma$-theory $T$ is finitely satisfiable, then it admits a model of cardinality $\leq\max\l\{\l|\sigma\r|,\aleph_0\r\}$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> This theorem actually follows immediately from the Completeness Theorem. Indeed, since $T$ is finitely satisfiable, every finite subtheory of $T$ is consistent and hence, by Syntactic Compactness, the entire theory $T$ is consistent; the Completeness Theorem then gives the desired model. Below, we give a ‘purely semantic’ proof of the Compactness Theorem instead.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
