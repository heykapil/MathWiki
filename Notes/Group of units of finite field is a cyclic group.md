title: Proposition.

Let $\F$ be a finite field. Then $\F^\times$ is cyclic.

```

<i>Proof.</i> Let $q\coloneqq\l|\F\r|$, so $\l|\F^\times\r|=q-1$. It suffices to show that every $p\divides\!\l(q-1\r)$ admits at most one subgroup $H$ of order $p$. Assume that such a subgroup $H\subgrpeq\F^\times$ exists. By Lagrangeâ€™s Theorem, every $h\in H$ has order dividing $p$, so $h^p=1$. Thus every $h\in H$ is a root of $x^p-1$. Conversely, since $x^p-1$ has at most $p$ roots and every $h\in H$ is a root, we see that $H$ consists of exactly the roots of $x^p-1$. In particular, this subgroup is unique.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
