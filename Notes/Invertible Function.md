title: Definition.

Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. A function $f:X\to Y$ is said to be <b>invertible</b> if there exists a function $g:Y\to X$ such that the diagram

commutes; that is, if $g$ is both a left and a right-inverse of $f$, in which case we write $g\coloneqq f^{-1}$ and call it the <b>inverse of $f$</b>. If such a function $f$ exists, then $X$ and $Y$ are said to be <b>isomorphic as sets</b>.

```

<b>Remark.</b> That is, invertible functions are isomorphisms in $\catset$. Since ‘is isomorphic to’ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $X\iso Y$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> We may relax the condition for $f$ to have both left and right inverses, since they coincide. Also, if $g,g':Y\to X$ are both inverses of $f$, then $g=g\circ\id_Y=g\circ\l(f\circ g'\r)=\l(g\circ f\r)\circ g=\id_X\circ g=g'$. Thus the inverse of a function is unique.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
