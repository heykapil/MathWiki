title: Proposition.

Let $v$ be a set and let $\phi\l(x,y\r)$ be a formula such that $\fa x\in v,\ex!y:\phi\l(x,y\r)$. Then there exists a function $f$ with $\dom f=v$ such that $\fa x\in v:\phi\l(x,f\l(x\r)\r)$.

```

<i>Proof.</i> Let $\psi\l(x,z\r)\,\colon\!\Leftrightarrow\ex y\l[\phi\l(x,y\r)\land z=\tpl{x,y}\r]$ and construct the set
$$\begin{equation}
    f\coloneqq\l\{z\st\ex x\in v:\psi\l(x,z\r)\r\}.
\end{equation}$$
* ($f$ is a set): To do so, we verify that $\fa x\in v,\ex!z:\psi\l(x,z\r)$. Take $x\in v$; by hypothesis, there exists a unique set $y$ such that $\phi\l(x,y\r)$, so set $z=\tpl{x,y}$ which is trivially unique.

* ($f$ is a binary relation): This is trivial; observe that, in particular, we have $\fa z\in f,\ex x,y:z=\tpl{x,y}$.

We can now prove that $f$ is a function with the remaining properties. Take any $x\in v$, so there exists a unique $y$ with $\phi\l(x,y\r)$. It suffices to prove that this is the unique $y$ with $\tpl{x,y}\in f$, for then $f\l(x\r)$ is defined to be this unique $y$ and thus $\phi\l(x,f\l(x\r)\r)$ holds. By definition of $f$, $\tpl{x,y}\in f$ implies that, in particular, we have $\phi\l(x,y\r)$. If $\ex y':\tpl{x,y'}\in f$, then $\phi\l(x,y'\r)$ too and thus $y=y'$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
