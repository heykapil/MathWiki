title: Definition.

Let $\cat{C}$ and $\cat{D}$ be categories. A functor $\ms{F}:\cat{C}\to\cat{D}$ is said to be <b>(weakly) invertible</b> if there exists a functor $\ms{G}:\cat{D}\to\cat{C}$ such that $\ms{G}$ is both a (weak) left and a (weak) right inverse of $\ms{F}$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> If $\ms{G}$ is both a strict left and a strict right inverse, we say that $\ms{F}$ is <b>strictly invertible</b>, in which case we write $\ms{G}\coloneqq\ms{F}^{-1}$ and call it the <b>strict inverse of $\ms{F}$</b>.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
