``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition (Characterizations of PIDs).

Let $R$ be an integral domain. Then $R$ is a PID iff for every finitely-generated $R$-module $M$ and every exact sequence $R^{m_0}\overset{\pi_0}{\longrightarrow}R\longrightarrow0$, there is a free $R$-module $R^{m_1}$ and a homomorphism $\pi_1:R^{m_1}\to R^{m_0}$ making
$$\begin{equation}
    0\longrightarrow R^{m_1}\overset{\pi_1}{\longrightarrow}R^{m_0}\overset{\pi_0}{\longrightarrow}M\longrightarrow0
\end{equation}$$
exact.

```

<i>Proof.</i> The forwards direction is a corollary of the Freedom Theorem for PIDs:
* ($\Rightarrow$): Let $\pi_0:R^{m_0}\onto M$ be a surjection. Its kernel is a submodule of the free module $R^{m_0}$, which is itself free, so there is an isomorphism $\pi_1:R^{m_1}\to\ker\pi_0$.

Conversely, let $I\nsubgrpeq R$ be an ideal and consider the module $M\coloneqq R/I$. An exact sequence $0\longrightarrow R^{m_1}\overset{\pi_1}{\longrightarrow}R/I\overset{\pi_0}{\longrightarrow}R\longrightarrow0$ shows that $I=\ker\pi_0=\im\pi_1$ is isomorphic to $R^{m_1}$, hence free. Viewing $I$ as an $R$-submodule of $R$, which has rank $1$, we see that $I$ is free of rank at most $1$. Thus $I$ is either trivial or generated by one element, as desired.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
