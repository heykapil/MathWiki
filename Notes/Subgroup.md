title: Definition.

A <b>subgroup</b> of a group $G$ is a group $H\subseteq G$ where the inclusion $H\into G$ is a group homomorphism, in which case we write $H\substructeq G$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> It is clear that $H\subseteq G$ is a subgroup of $G$ iff $0\in H$ and that $H$ is closed under the operation and inversion.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
