title: Definition.

Let $\Z$ denote the set of integers. The <b>ring of integers</b> is the ring $\tpl{\Z,+,\cdot}$ equipped with the standard addition and multiplication operators.

```

<b>Remark.</b> We claim that $\Z$ is initial in $\catring$. Indeed, for any ring $R$, that $\Z=\gen{1}$ as a group furnishes a unique group homomorphism $\phi:\Z\to R$ sending $1$ to $1_R$. That $\phi\l(rs\r)=\phi\l(r\r)\phi\l(s\r)$ is easy to check, so $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
