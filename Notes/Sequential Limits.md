title: Definition.

Let $X$ be a topological space. A sequence $\tpl{x_n}$ in $X$ is said to <b>converge</b> to some $x\in X$, written $x_n\to x$, if all neighborhoods $U\ni x$ contains cofinitely-many $x_n$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> If $x_n\to x$, then $x$ is said to be a <i>limit</i> of $\tpl{x_n}$. If $X$ is Hausdorff, then such an $x$ is unique.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
