title: Proposition.

Let $X$ be a set and let $<$ be binary relation on $X$. Then $<$ is a total order on $X$ iff $<$ is transitive and asymmetric on $X$.

```

<i>Proof.</i> ($\Rightarrow$): If $<$ is a strict total order on $X$, then $<$ is transitive and irreflexive on $X$. Together, this implies that $<$ is asymmetric on $X$.

($\Leftarrow$): If $<$ is transitive and asymmetric on $X$, then, since asymmetry implies irreflexivity, we see that $<$ is irreflexive on $X$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
