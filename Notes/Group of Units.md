``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

Let $R$ be a ring. The <b>group of units of $R$</b> is the group $R^\times\coloneqq\l\{u\in R\st\ex r\in R:ur=1=ru\r\}$, whose elements are called <b>units</b>.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Observe that $R^\times=R\comp\l\{0\r\}$ iff $R$ is a division ring.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
