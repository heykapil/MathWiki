title: Proposition.

Let $G$ be a non-trivial $p$-group. If $H\nsubgrpeq G$ is non-trivial, then $H\cap Z\l(G\r)$ is also non-trivial. We have the following corollaries:
* If $H\nsubgrpeq G$ is of order $p$, then $H\subgrpeq Z\l(G\r)$.
* If $H\nsubgrp G$ is proper, then there is a subgroup $K\nsubgrp G$ containing $H$ such that $\l[K:H\r]=p$.
* If $\l|G\r|=p^n$, then there is a chain $\l\{e\r\}=H_0\subgrp\cdots\subgrp H_n=G$ of subgroups such that each $H_i\nsubgrp G$ and $\l|H_i\r|=p^i$.

<i>Proof.</i> Let $G$ act on $H$ by conjugation. Then $H\cap Z\l(G\r)=\l\{h\in H\mid\fa g\in G:gh=hg\r\}$ is the set of fixed points of the action, so, since $G$ is a non-trivial $p$-group, we have from the class equation that $\l|H\cap Z\l(G\r)\r|\equiv\l|H\r|\mod p$. But $\l|H\r|$ is $p$-subgroup by Lagrangeâ€™s Theorem, so $\l|H\cap Z\l(G\r)\r|$ is a multiple of $p$, hence non-trivial.
* Every group of prime order is cyclic and is generated by every non-trivial element, so any non-trivial $x\in H\cap Z\l(G\r)$ generates $H=\gen{x}\subgrpeq Z\l(G\r)$.
* Let $\pi:G\to G/H$ denote the projection. Since $G/H$ is a non-trivial $p$-group, there is a non-trivial $x\in Z\l(G/H\r)$. It generates a subgroup of $G/H$, so $\ord{x}=p^r$ for some $r\in\N$. Set $y\coloneqq x^{p^{r-1}}$ and observe that $\ord{y}=p$, so consider the subgroup $K_0\coloneqq\gen{y}$ of $G/H$. Set $K\coloneqq\pi^{-1}\!\l(K_0\r)$, which is a normal subgroup in $G$ containing $H$ since $\pi\l(h\r)=0\in K_0$ for all $h\in H$. Now, since $\ker\pi=H\leq K$ and $\pi\l(H\r)=\l\{e\r\}\nsubgrpeq K_0=\pi\l(K\r)$, we see from the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem that
$$\begin{equation}
    K/H\iso\pi\l(K\r)/\pi\l(H\r)=K_0/\l\{e\r\}\iso K_0.
\end{equation}$$
Thus $\l[K:H\r]=\l|K/H\r|=\l|K_0\r|=p$, as desired.
* Induct with base case $H_0\coloneqq\l\{e\r\}\nsubgrp G$. If $H_i$ is constructed, then there is a subgroup $H_{i+1}\nsubgrp G$ such that $\l|H_{i+1}\r|/\l|H_i\r|=p$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
