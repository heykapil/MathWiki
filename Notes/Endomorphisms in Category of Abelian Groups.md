title: Definition.

The <b>endomorphism ring</b> of an abelian group $G$ is the ring $\End_\catabgrp\!\l(G\r)$ under with the induced addition from $G$ and composition of maps.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Its additive/multiplicative identities are the zero/identity functions, respectively.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
