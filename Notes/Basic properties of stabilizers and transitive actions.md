title: Proposition.

Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $X$ and let $x,y\in X$. Then the following properties hold.
* If $x$ and $y$ are in the same orbit, then $G_x$ is conjugate to $G_y$.
* If $G$ acts transitively on $X$, then $G_x=G_y$ iff there exists a $G$-automorphism $\phi:X\to X$ such that $\phi\l(x\r)=y$.
* If $G$ acts transitively on $X$, then $\Aut\l(X\r)\iso N_G\!\l(G_x\r)/G_x$ as groups.

<i>Proof.</i>
* If $y=gx$ for some $g\in G$, then for all $h\in G_x$, we see that $hx=x$ and hence $\l(ghg^{-1}\r)y=\l(ghg^{-1}\r)gx=ghx=gx=y$. Thus $ghg^{-1}\in G_y$. Conversely, for all $h\in G_y$, we see that $hy=y$ and hence $hgx=gx$. Then $\l(g^{-1}hg\r)x=x$, so $g^{-1}hg\in G_x$ and hence $h\in gG_xg^{-1}$.
* For all $z\in X$, there is some $g\in G$ such that $z=gx$ and we define $\phi\l(z\r)\coloneqq gy$. This is well-defined since if $z=gx=g'x$, then $g^{-1}g'x=x$ and hence $g^{-1}g'y=y$ by assumption. Thus $gy=g'y$, as desired. Clearly $\phi\l(x\r)=y$, and it is equivariant since $\phi\l(az\r)=\phi\l(agx\r)=agy=a\phi\l(z\r)$ for all $a\in G$ and $z\in X$. Finally, $\phi$ is invertible with inverse $\phi^{-1}\!\l(g'y\r)=g'x$. Conversely, if $gx=x$, then $gy=g\phi\l(x\r)=\phi\l(gx\r)=\phi\l(x\r)=y$ and some $g\in G_y$. That $G_y\subseteq G_x$ is similar, so $G_x=G_y$.
* We define a map $\Gamma:N_G\!\l(G_x\r)\to\Aut\l(X\r)$ whose kernel is $G_x$, from which the result follows. Take $g\in N_g\!\l(G_x\r)$ and define a map $\phi_g\in\Aut\l(X\r)$ as follows. For all $z\in X$, let $h\in G$ be such that $z=hx$, and define $\phi_g\!\l(z\r)\coloneqq hg^{-1}x$. This is well-defined, for if $hx=h'x$, then $h^{-1}h'\in G_x$ and hence $gh^{-1}h'g^{-1}\in gG_xg^{-1}=G_x$. Thus $hg^{-1}G_x=h'g^{-1}G_x$ as desired. Similarly as above, it is an equivariant bijection. Define $\Gamma\l(g\r)\coloneqq\phi_g$, which makes $\Gamma$ a homomorphism since
$$\begin{equation}
    \begin{gathered}
        \Gamma\l(g_1g_2\r)\l(z\r)=\phi_{g_1g_2}\!\l(z\r)=h\l(g_1g_2\r)^{-1}x=hg_2^{-1}g_1^{-1}x \\
        \l[\Gamma\l(g_1\r)\circ\Gamma\l(g_2\r)\r]\l(z\r)=\l(\phi_{g_1}\circ\phi_{g_2}\r)\l(z\r)=\phi_{g_1}\!\l(hg_2^{-1}x\r)=hg_2^{-1}\phi_{g_1}\!\l(x\r)=hg_2^{-1}g_1^{-1}x.
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation}$$
If $\Gamma\l(g\r)=\id$, then $\phi_g\!\l(z\r)=z$ for all $z\in X$ and hence $hgx=hx$. Thus $gx=x$, so $g\in G_x$. Conversely, if $gx=x$, then $hgx=hx$ for all $h\in G$. Since the action is transitive, this shows that $\phi_g\!\l(z\r)=z$ for all $z\in X$, so $\Gamma\l(g\r)=\id$. Thus $\ker\Gamma=G_x$, as desired. Lastly, for all $\phi\in\Aut\l(X\r)$, there is some $a\in G$ such that $\phi\l(x\r)=ax$. Set $g\coloneqq a^{-1}$, which we claim to be in $N_G\!\l(G_x\r)$ and that $\phi=\phi_g$. Indeed, for all $z=hx\in X$, we have $\phi_g\!\l(z\r)=hg^{-1}x=hax=h\phi\l(x\r)=\phi\l(hx\r)=\phi\l(z\r)$. It remains to show that $a\in N_g\!\l(G_x\r)$. Take $h\in G_x$ and observe that $a^{-1}hax=a^{-1}h\phi\l(x\r)=a^{-1}\phi\l(hx\r)=a^{-1}\phi\l(x\r)=a^{-1}ax=x$, as desired.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
