``` ad-Definition
title: Definition (Filters and Ultrafilters).

A <b>filter</b> on a Boolean algebra $B$ is a subset $F\subseteq B\comp\l\{0\r\}$ that is closed upwards and closed under finite meets. If $I$ is a set, a <b>filter</b> on $I$ is a filter on $\tpl{\pow\l(I\r),\subseteq}$.
* An <b>ultrafilter</b> on $B$ is a proper $\subseteq$-maximal filter. Equivalently, it is a filter $U$ on $B$ such that for all $a\in B$, either $a\in U$ or $\lnot a\in U$.
* A filter $F$ on $B$ is <b>principal</b> if there is some atom $a_0\in B$ such that $F=\l\{a\in B\st a\geq a_0\r\}$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> We justify the equivalence of the definition of an ultrafilter $U$ as follows. Let $U$ be a proper $\subseteq$-maximal filter on $B$ and take $a\in B$. If $a\not\in U$, consider the collection $U'\coloneqq\l\{b\in I\st b\geq\lnot c\textrm{ for some }c\in U\r\}$, which is a filter on $B$ containing $U$. Since $\lnot a\in U'$, the maximality of $U$ forces $\lnot a\in U$. The converse is easy.
* Thus we can think of an ultrafilter $U$ as a finitely-additive $2$-valued measure $\mu$ on $B$. In particular, every principal filter is an ultrafilter.

By Zornâ€™s Lemma, every filter $F$ is contained in an ultrafilter. Indeed, the union of any chain in the collection $\mc{F}\coloneqq\l\{G\subseteq B\st G\supseteq F\textrm{ is a filter}\r\}$ is contained in $\mc{F}$, so we have a $\subseteq$-maximal element $U\supseteq F$. This gives us the existence of a non-principal ultrafilter $U$ on $I$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span> ^ultrafilter-lemma
