``` ad-Theorem
title: Theorem (Linear Invertibility Theorem).

Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space, say with $n\coloneqq\dim V$, and let $T\in\End\l(V\r)$. The following are equivalent:
1. $T$ is invertible.
2. $\im T=V$ (equivalently, $\rank T=n$).
3. $\ker T=\l\{0\r\}$ (equivalently, $\nullity T=0$).
4. $\det T\neq0$.
5. $T^\dual$ is invertible.

<i>Proof.</i> Clearly $1\Rightarrow2$ and $1\Rightarrow3$. Conversely, $2\Leftrightarrow3$ by the Dimension Theorem and they each imply $1$. It remains to show that $1\Leftrightarrow4$ and $1\Leftrightarrow5$.
* ($1\Leftrightarrow4$): 
* ($1\Leftrightarrow5$):
