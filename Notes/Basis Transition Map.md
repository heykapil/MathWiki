title: Definition.

Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over some field $K$, say with $n\coloneqq\dim V$, and let $\mc{B}$ and $\mc{B}'$ be bases thereof. The <b>basis transition map from $\mc{B}$ to $\mc{B}'$</b> is the unique linear isomorphism $\psi:K^n\to K^n$ such that the diagram

commutes; that is, $\psi\coloneqq\phi_{\mc{B}'}\circ\phi_\mc{B}^{-1}$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> The transition map can also be written as $\psi_{\mc{B}\to\mc{B}'}$ to emphasize the fact that $\psi\l(\l[v\r]_\mc{B}\r)=\l[v\r]_{\mc{B}'}$ for all $v\in V$; that is, it takes the coordinate representations of vectors in $\mc{B}$ and maps them to its corresponding representation in $\mc{B}'$. As a matrix $\psi_{\mc{B}\to\mc{B}'}$ is represented as $\l[\id_V\r]_\mc{B}^{\mc{B}'}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
