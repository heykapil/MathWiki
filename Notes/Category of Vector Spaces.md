title: Definition.

Let $K$ be a field. The <b>category of vector spaces over $K$</b> is the (locally-small) category $\catvect[K]$ whose objects are vector spaces and whose morphisms are linear maps.

```

<b>Remark.</b> That $\catvect[K]$ is a category follows from the fact that identities and compositions of linear maps are linear.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
