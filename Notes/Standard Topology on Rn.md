title: Definition.

Let $\sttopR$ be the standard topology on the real numbers $\R$. The <b>standard topology on $\R^n$</b> is the product topology $\sttopR[n]\coloneqq\prod_{i=1}^n\sttopR$ on $\R^n$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Since $\sttopR[n]$ can be generated by the basis $\mc{B}$ containing all Cartesian products of open intervals in $\R$, we can visualize elements in $\mc{B}$ the interior of an $\textrm{`}n$-dimensionalâ€™ cube.

Furthermore, since $\sttopR$ can also be generated by the basis $\mc{B}_\R'$ containing open intervals in $\R$ with rational endpoints, the collection $\mc{B}'$ containing Cartesian products of elements thereof also form a basis for $\sttopR[n]$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
