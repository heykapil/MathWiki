title: Definition.

Let $X$ be a set and let $\mc{T}$ be a topology on $X$. An <b>open set of $X$ in $\mc{T}$</b> is an element $U\in\mc{T}$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Fix $x\in X$. An open set $U\in\mc{T}$ is said to be a <b>neighborhood of $x$</b> if $x\in U$. The set of all neighborhoods of $x$ is denoted by $\mc{U}_x$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
