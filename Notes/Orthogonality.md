title: Definition.

Let $V$ be an inner product space. Two vectors $u,w\in V$ are said to be <b>orthogonal</b> if $\inprod{u}{w}=0$, in which case we write $u\perp w$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Other derived notions are:
* A vector $u\in V$ is said to be <b>orthogonal</b> to a subspace $W\subseteq V$ if $u\perp w$ for all $w\in W$, in which case we write $u\perp W$. This is equivalent to saying that $u\in W^\perp$.
* Two subspaces $U,W\subseteq V$ are said to be <b>orthogonal</b> if $u\perp w$ for all $u\in U$ and $w\in W$, in which case we write $U\perp W$. This is equivalent to saying that $U=W^\perp$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
