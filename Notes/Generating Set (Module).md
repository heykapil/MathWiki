title: Definition.

Let $X\subseteq M$ be a subset of an $R$-module $M$ over a commutative ring $R$. The <b>submodule generated by $X$</b> is the image $\gen{X}\coloneqq\im\l(F^R\!\l(X\r)\to M\r)$ of the unique $R$-module homomorphism extending $X\into M$.
* If $F^R\!\l(X\r)\onto M$, then $M$ is said to be <b>generated by $X$</b>. If furthermore $X$ is finite, then $M$ is said to be <b>finitely-generated</b>.
* If $F^R\!\l(X\r)\into M$, then $X$ is said to be <b>linearly independent</b>.
* If $F^R\!\l(X\r)\iso M$, then $X$ is said to be a <b>basis for $M$</b>.

The cardinality of any maximally linearly independent subset $X\subseteq M$ is called the <b>rank of $M$</b>, denoted $\rk_RM$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Observe that an $R$-module is free iff it admits a basis, and different choices of bases amounts to different choices of isomorphisms $F^R\!\l(X\r)\iso M$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> If $F^R\!\l(X\r)\iso M$ is free, then $\rk_RM=\l|X\r|$ too. This holds for all rings with the ‘Invariant Basis Number’ property, which commutative rings satisfy.
* If $k$ is a field and $V$ is a $k$-vector space, we write $\dim_k\!V\coloneqq\rk_k\!V$ and call it the <b>dimension of $V$</b>.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> Equivalently, $\gen{X}$ is the submodule consisting of all $m\in M$ that can be expressed as a (finite) <b>linear combination</b> $\sum r_ix_i$ of elements $x_i\in M$. In this language, we can rephrase the above as follows:
* $F^R\!\l(X\r)\onto M$ iff every $m\in M$ can be written as a linear combination $m=\sum_{x\in X}r_xx$ for some $r_x\in R$.
* $F^R\!\l(X\r)\into M$ iff the only vanishing linear combination $\sum_{x\in X}r_xx=0$ is with $r_x=0$ for all $x\in X$.
* $F^R\!\l(X\r)\iso M$ iff every $m\in M$ can be written <i>uniquely</i> as a linear combination $m=\sum_{x\in X} r_xx$ for some $r_i\in R$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
