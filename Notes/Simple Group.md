title: Definition.

A group $G$ is said to be <b>simple</b> if it has no non-trivial normal subgroups.

```

<b>Remark.</b> If $G$ is a finite simple group having a subgroup with index $n>1$, then $\l|G\r|$ divides $n!$. Indeed, every subgroup $H\subgrpeq G$ of index $n$ contains a normal subgroup $K\nsubgrpeq G$ such that $\l[G:K\r]$ divides $n!$, but since $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$ and $G$ is simple, we see that $K$ is trivial and hence $\l[G:K\r]=\l|G\r|$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
