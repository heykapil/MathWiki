title: Theorem (Borel Measures on $\R$).

For any increasing right-continuous function $f:\R\to\R$, there is a unique Borel measure $\mu_f$ with $\mu_f\!\l(a,b\r]=f\l(b\r)-f\l(a\r)$, and conversely every Borel measure $\mu$ on $\R$ that is finite on bounded sets is given by such a function $f$, which is unique up to a constant.

```

<b>Remark.</b> For such a function $f:\R\to\R$, the Borel measure $\mu_f$ is called a <i>Lebesgue-Steiltjes</i> measure on $\R$. The <i>Lebesgue</i> measure on $\R$ is $\lambda\coloneqq\mu_\id$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span> ^lebesgue

<i>Proof.</i> Given a Borel measure $\mu$ on $\R$, let $f_\mu:\R\to\R$ be defined by $x\mapsto\mu\l(0,x\r]$ if $x\geq0$ and $x\mapsto-\mu\l(x,0\r]$ if $x<0$, which is clearly increasing. To show that it is right-continuous, take $x\in\R$ and let $x_n\decto x$.
* If $x\geq0$, then $f_\mu\!\l(x\r)=\mu\l(0,x\r]=\lim_n\mu\l(0,x_n\r]=\lim_nf_\mu\!\l(x_n\r)$ since $\l(0,x\r]=\bigcap_n\l(0,x_n\r]$ and $\mu\l(0,x_n\r]<\infty$. The $x<0$ case follows similarly with $\l(x,0\r]=\bigcup_n\l(x_n,0\r]$.

Such a function is unique since if $g:\R\to\R$ is another, then, for every $x\in\R$, we have $f_\mu\!\l(x\r)-f\l(0\r)=g\l(x\r)-g\l(0\r)$ and hence $f_\mu\!\l(x\r)-g\l(x\r)=f\l(0\r)-g\l(0\r)$.

For the main direction, let $f:\R\to\R$ be an increasing right-continuous function. We first define $\mu_f$ as a premeasure on the algebra $\mc{A}$ generated by half-intervals $\l(a,b\r]$. Since $\R=\bigsqcup_{n\in\Z}\l(n,n+1\r]$ is $\sigma$-finite, we obtain by CarathÃ©odory a measure $\mu_f$ on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mc{B}\l(\R\r)$. Indeed, every $A\in\mc{A}$ can be written as a finite disjoint union $A=\bigsqcup_{n<k}\l(a_n,b_n\r]$, for which we set $\mu_f\!\l(A\r)\coloneqq\sum_{n<k}\mu_f\!\l(a_n,b_n\r]=\sum_{n<k}\l[f\l(b_n\r)-f\l(a_n\r)\r]$. This is well-defined, for if $A=\bigsqcup_{n<k}I_n=\bigsqcup_{m<l}J_m$ where $I_n$ and $J_m$ are half-intervals, then taking their common refinement $\l\{I_n\cap J_m\r\}$ gives us that
$$\begin{equation}
    \sum_{n<k}\mu_f\!\l(I_n\r)=\sum_{n<k,m<l}\mu_f\!\l(I_n\cap J_m\r)=\sum_{m<l}\mu_f\!\l(J_m\r).
\end{equation}$$
Thus $\mu_f$ is a finitely-additive premeasure on $\mc{A}$, so it is countably-supadditive. It remains to show that $\mu_f$ is countably-subadditive, so take $A=\bigsqcup_n\l(a_n,b_n\r]\in\mc{A}$. Note that $A$ can be written as a <i>finite</i> disjoint union of half-intervals, so $\l\{\l(a_n,b_n\r]\r\}$ can be partitioned into finitely-many subsequences, each of which unions up to a single half-interval. By finite-additivity, we may w.l.o.g. assume that $A\eqqcolon\l(a,b\r]$ is a single half interval.
* Suppose that $A$ is bounded. Fix $\epsilon>0$ and choose $a'\in\l(a,a+\delta\r)$ and $b_n'\in\l(b_n,b_n+\delta_n\r)$, where $\delta$ and $\delta_n$ are by right-continuity of $f$ chosen small-enough so that $f\l(a'\r)\approx_\epsilon f\l(a\r)$ and $f\l(b_n'\r)\approx_{\epsilon/2^{n+1}}f\l(b_n\r)$. Then $\l[a',b\r]\subseteq\bigcup_n\l(a_n,b_n'\r)$, so by compactness we obtain a subcover $\l[a',b\r]\subseteq\bigcup_{n<N}\l(a_n,b_n'\r)$. Observe then that
$$\begin{equation}
    \mu_f\!\l(a,b\r]\approx_\epsilon\mu_f\!\l(a',b\r]\leq\sum_{n<N}\mu_f\!\l(a_n,b_n'\r]\leq\sum_n\mu_f\!\l(a_n,b_n'\r]\approx_\epsilon\sum_n\mu_f\!\l(a_n,b_n\r].
\end{equation}$$

For the unbounded case, let $l\in\R^+$ and set $I_l\coloneqq\l(-l,l\r]$. Then $I_l\cap A=I_l\cap\bigsqcup_n\l(a_n,b_n\r]=\bigsqcup_n\l(I_l\cap\l(a_n,b_n\r]\r)$ is bounded, so it follows from the previous case that $\mu_f\!\l(I_l\cap A\r)=\sum_n\mu_f\!\l(I_l\cap\l(a_n,b_n\r]\r)\leq\sum_n\mu_f\!\l(a_n,b_n\r]$. Letting $l\to\infty$ gives the desired result.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
