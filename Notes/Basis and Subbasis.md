title: Definition.

Let $\tpl{X,\mc{T}}$ be a topological space. A <b>basis</b> for $\mc{T}$ is a family $\mc{B}\subseteq\mc{T}$ such that every open set $U\in\mc{T}$ is a union of elements of $\mc{B}$.
* More generally, a <b>subbasis</b> for $\mc{T}$ is a family $\mc{S}\subseteq\mc{T}$ such that every open set $U\in\mc{T}$ is a union of finite intersections of elements of $\mc{S}$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Equivalently, $\mc{B}$ is a basis for $\mc{T}$ iff every $x\in X$ admits a <i>neighborhood basis</i>; i.e. a family $\mc{N}_x\subseteq\mc{T}$ of neighborhoods of $x$ such that if $U\ni x$ is an open set, then there is some neighborhood $V\in\mc{N}_x$ of $x$ contained in $U$.
* Indeed, if $\mc{B}$ is a basis for $\mc{T}$ and $x\in X$, then $\l\{V\in\mc{B}\st x\in V\r\}$ is a neighborhood basis for $x$. Conversely, if $U$ is open, then every $x\in X$ admits a neighborhood $V_x\ni x$ contained in $U$. Thus $U=\bigcup_{x\in U}V_x$, so $\mc{B}$ is a basis for $\mc{T}$.

A family $\mc{B}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ is a basis for <i>some</i> topology on $X$ iff $\mc{B}$ covers $X$ and for all $x\in B_1\cap B_2$ with $B_1,B_2\in\mc{B}$, there exists $B\in\mc{B}$ with $x\in B\subseteq B_1\cap B_2$. Furthermore, every family $\mc{S}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ that covers $X$ is a subbasis for <i>some</i> topology on $X$; namely, the topology $\mc{T}_\mc{S}\coloneqq\bigcap_{\mc{T}\ni\mc{S}}\mc{T}$ <i>generated by $\mc{S}$</i>.
* The forward direction is trivial. Conversely, consider the topology $\mc{T}_\mc{B}\coloneqq\l\{U\subseteq X\st\fa x\in U,\ex B\in\mc{B}:x\in B\subseteq U\r\}$ <i>generated by $\mc{B}$</i>. That $\em,X\in\mc{T}_\mc{B}$ and $\mc{T}_\mc{B}$ is closed under (arbitrary) unions is easy to see. If $U_1,U_2\in\mc{T}_\mc{B}$, then for any $x\in U_1\cap U_2$ there exist bases $B_1,B_2\in\mc{B}$ so that $x\in B_1\subseteq U_1$ and $x\in B_2\subseteq U_2$. Thus there is a basis element $B\in\mc{B}$ such that $x\in B\subseteq U_1\cap U_2$, showing that $U_1\cap U_2\in\mc{T}_\mc{B}$ too. Finally, that $\mc{B}$ is a basis for $\mc{T}$ is clear.
* To show that $\mc{S}$ is a subbasis for $\mc{T}_\mc{S}$, it suffices to show that the family $\mc{B}\subseteq\mc{T}_\mc{S}$ obtained by intersecting finitely-many elements of $\mc{S}$ is a basis for $\mc{T}_\mc{S}$. Indeed, since $\mc{S}$ covers $X$, any $x\in X$ is covered by the intersection of the singleton $\l\{S\r\}$ where $x\in S\in\mc{S}$. Moreover, if $B_1,B_2\in\mc{B}$ and $x\in B_1\cap B_2$, then $x$ is still in the intersection of finitely-many elements of $S$. This intersection is in $\mc{B}$, so we are done.

In other words, given a basis $\mc{B}$ for a topology on $X$, the topology $\mc{T}_\mc{B}$ that it generates consists of (arbitrary) unions of elements of $\mc{B}$. Furthermore, given a collection $\mc{S}$ covering $X$, the topology $\mc{T}_\mc{S}$ that it generates consists of (arbitrary) unions of finite intersections of elements of $\mc{S}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
