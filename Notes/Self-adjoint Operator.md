title: Definition.

A linear operator $T:V\to V$ on an inner product space $V$ is said to be <b>self-adjoint</b> if $T=T^\adj$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Self-adjoint operators are analogous to complex numbers $z\in\C$ such that $z=\bar{z}$, which occurs iff $z\in\R$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

---

<b>Remark.</b> Every self-adjoint operator is clear normal.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
