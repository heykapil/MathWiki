``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

Let $\tpl{X,\mc{T}}$ be a topological space. A subset $C\subseteq X$ is said to be a <b>closed set of $X$ w.r.t. $\mc{T}$</b> if $X\comp C$ is open in $\mc{T}$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Note that $C$ is closed iff $C=\bar{C}$. Indeed, if $C$ is closed, then, since $C$ is the smallest closed set containing itself, $C=\bar{C}$. Conversely, $\bar{C}$ is closed, so $C$ is also closed.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
