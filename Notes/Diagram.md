title: Definition.

Let $\cat{J}$ and $\cat{C}$ be categories. A <b>diagram of type $\cat{J}$ in $\cat{C}$</b> is a functor $\ms{D}:\cat{J}\to\cat{C}$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> The category $\cat{J}$ is, in this context, referred to as the <b>index category</b>.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

---

<b>Remark.</b> This notion generalizes that of an indexed family but emphasizes the morphisms from $\ms{D}\l(j_1\r)$ to $\ms{D}\l(j_2\r)$ more than the objects themselves; hence the name ‘diagram’. The visualization of a diagram consists of ‘nodes’, which represent objects of the form $\ms{D}\l(j_n\r)$, and ‘arrows’, which represent morphisms $\ms{D}\l(j_k\r)\to\ms{D}\l(j_l\r)$ in $\cat{C}$; the identity and composite morphisms are omitted.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
