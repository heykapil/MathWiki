title: Definition.

Let $X$ be a set. An <b>algebra</b> on $X$ is a family $\mc{A}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ that is closed under complements and finite unions.
* If $\mc{A}$ is closed under complements and countable unions, then $\mc{A}$ is a <b>$\sigma$-algebra</b> on $X$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> By De Morganâ€™s Laws, that $\mc{A}$ is closed under finite (countable) unions is equivalent to it being closed under finite (countable) intersections.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
