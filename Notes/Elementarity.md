title: Definition (Elementarity).

Let $\sigma$ be a signature in $\FOL$. We say that a $\sigma$-structure $\mc{A}$ <b>elementarily embeds</b> in $\mc{B}$, written $\mc{A}\eleminto\mc{B}$, if there is a homomorphism $h:\mc{A}\to\mc{B}$ such that for all $\sigma$-formulas $\phi(\vec{v})$ and $\vec{a}\in A^{|\vec{v}|}$, we have $\mc{A}\models\phi(\vec{a})$ iff $\mc{B}\models\phi(h(\vec{a}))$. Such a homomorphism $h$ is said to be an <b>elementary embedding</b>, written $h:\mc{A}\eleminto\mc{B}$.
* A substructure $\mc{A}\substructeq\mc{B}$ is said to be <b>elementary</b>, written $\mc{A}\elemembed\mc{B}$, if $\iota:\mc{A}\eleminto\mc{B}$. In this case, we also say that $\mc{B}$ is an <b>elementary extension</b> of $\mc{A}$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> In other words, $h:\mc{A}\eleminto\mc{B}$ if $h$ preserves all first-order $\sigma$-formulas. A weaker notion is that of an <i>elementary equivalence</i>, which only requires $h$ to preserve all first-order $\sigma$-sentences; that is, $\mc{A}$ and $\mc{B}$ are elementarily equivalent, written $\mc{A}\elemequiv\mc{B}$, if $\Th\mc{A}=\Th\mc{B}$. Note that $\mc{A}\iso\mc{B}$ implies, by induction on the construction of $\sigma$-sentences, that $\mc{A}\elemequiv\mc{B}$. The converse is not true; take, for instance, $\tpl{\Q,<}$ and $\tpl{\R,<}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> A useful criterion for $\mc{A}\elemembed\mc{B}$ is the <i>Tarski-Vaught Test</i>: we have an $\mc{A}\elemembed\mc{B}$ iff for every $\sigma$-formula $\phi(\vec{x},y)$ and every $\vec{a}\in A^{|\vec{x}|}$, if $\mc{B}\models\ex y\phi(\vec{a},y)$, then there is some $a'\in A$ such that $\mc{B}\models\phi(\vec{a},a')$. That is, $\mc{A}\elemembed\mc{B}$ iff any $\sigma$-formula $\ex y\phi(\vec{a},y)$ can always be witnessed by some $a'\in A$. ^Tarski-Vaught-test
* Indeed, the forwards direction is trivial. For the backwards, let $\phi(\vec{x})$ be a $\sigma$-formula and take $\vec{a}\in A^{|\vec{x}|}$. We show that $\mc{A}\models\phi(\vec{a})$ iff $\mc{B}\models\phi(\vec{a})$ by induction on the complexity of $\phi$, for which the only non-trivial case is when $\phi(\vec{x})=\ex y\psi(\vec{x},y)$. But $\mc{B}\models\phi(\vec{a})$ iff $\mc{B}\models\ex y\psi(\vec{a},y)$, so the Tarski-Vaught condition furnishes a witness $a'\in A$ such that $\mc{B}\models\psi(\vec{a},a')$. That $\mc{A}\models\psi(\vec{a},a')$ holds by induction, so $\mc{A}\models\phi(\vec{a})$ as desired. Note that this also shows $\mc{A}\substructeq\mc{B}$, since we may take $\phi(x)\coloneqq x=c$ to show that $c\in A$ for each $c\in\mc{C}\l(\sigma\r)$, and take $\phi(\vec{x},y)\coloneqq f(\vec{x})=y$ to show that $f(\vec{a})\in A$ for each $f\in\mc{F}_n\!\l(\sigma\r)$ and $\vec{a}\in A^n$.

This test also gives us simple examples of $\sigma$-structures $\mc{A}\substructeq\mc{B}$ such that $\mc{A}\elemequiv\mc{B}$ but are <i>not</i> elementary. Indeed, let $\sigma\coloneqq\tpl{<}$ and consider the isomorphic $\sigma$-structures $\mc{A}\coloneqq\tpl{\N_{>0},<}$ and $\mc{B}\coloneqq\tpl{\N,<}$. Clearly $\mc{A}\elemequiv\mc{B}$, but the $\sigma$-formula $\phi(y)\coloneqq\lnot\ex z(z<y)$ is only witnessed by $0\not\in A$ in $\mc{B}$. In general, the failure of a $\sigma$-substructure to be elementary is the lack of those witnesses, called <i>Skolem witnesses</i>, which are used in the <i>Downward LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem Theorem</i> to build elementary substructures.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
