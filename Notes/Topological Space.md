title: Definition.

Let $X$ be a set. A <b>topology on $X$</b> is a family $\mc{T}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ of <b>open sets</b> containing $\em$ and $X$ and is closed under (arbitrary) unions and finite intersections. The pair $\tpl{X,\mc{T}}$ is called a <b>topological space</b>.
* A function $f:X\to Y$ is said to be <b>continuous</b> if preimages of open sets are open.
* The <b>category of topological spaces</b> is the category $\cattop$ whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are continuous functions.

^continuous-function

<b>Remark.</b> The isomorphisms in $\cattop$ are continuous bijections whose inverse is also continuous. The second condition is necessary; for instance, $\exp:\l[0,1\r)\to S^1$ is a continuous bijection whose inverse is <i>not</i> continuous. A sufficient condition for a continuous bijection $f:X\to Y$ to have a continuous inverse is that $X$ is compact and $Y$ is Hausdorff, in which case every closed set $F\subseteq X$ is compact, so $f\l(F\r)$ is compact and hence closed too. ^isomorphisms

The category of $\cattop$ admit subobjects, quotients, products, and coproducts.
* (<i>Subspace</i>). We equip a subset $S\subseteq X$ with the topology whose open sets are of the form $U\cap S$ for some open set $U$ of $X$. If $\mc{B}$ is a basis for the topology on $X$, then the subspace topology contains open sets of the form $B\cap S$ for $B\in\mc{B}$ instead. Similarly for subbasis. ^subspace
* (<i>Product</i>). We equip the product $X\times Y$ with the topology generated by the basis $\mc{B}\coloneqq\l\{U\times V\st U\in\mc{T}_X,V\in\mc{T}_Y\r\}$. If $\mc{B}_X$ and $\mc{B}_Y$ are bases for $\mc{T}_X$ and $\mc{T}_y$, then we may take $U\in\mc{B}_X$ and $V\in\mc{B}_Y$ instead. The product topology also admits a subbasis of all sets of the form $\pi^{-1}_X\!\l(U\r)$ and $\pi^{-1}_Y\!\l(V\r)$ for $U\in\mc{T}_X$ and $V\in\mc{T}_Y$. ^product-space
* (<i>Quotient</i>). We equip a quotient $X/\!\sim$ with the topology by declaring $U\subseteq X/\!\sim$ to be open iff $p^{-1}\!\l(U\r)\subseteq X$ is open. If $A\subseteq X$ and $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $X$, the <i>saturation</i> of $A$ is $\l[A\r]\coloneqq\l\{x\in X\st\ex a\in A:x\sim a\r\}$. A subset $A\subseteq X$ is said to be <i>saturated</i> if $\l[A\r]=A$. ^quotient
    * A sufficient condition for the quotient $q:A\to A/\!\sim$ to be homeomorphic to $p:X\to X/\!\sim$ is that $\l[A\r]=X$ and, for all saturated open sets $U\subseteq A$, the set $\l[U\r]$ is open in $X$ too. Indeed, it follows from $\l[A\r]=X$ that the continuous natural map $\phi:A/\!\sim\,\to X/\!\sim$ is a bijection. A computation now shows that $p^{-1}\!\l(\phi\l(V\r)\r)=\l[q^{-1}\!\l(V\r)\r]$, so for every open set $V\subseteq A/\!\sim$, its image $\phi\l(V\r)\subseteq X/\!\sim$ is open too. Hence $\phi$ is a homeomorphism, as desired.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

<b>Remark.</b> Instead of a topology $\mc{T}$ on $X$, we may equivalently consider a family $\mc{F}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ containing $\em$ and $X$, whose elements are called <i>closed sets</i>, but is now closed under (arbitrary) intersections and finite unions instead. Every topology induces a family of closed sets and vice-versa.
* We may also phrase the continuity of $f:X\to Y$ by saying that the preimages of closed sets are closed. This is clear since $f^{-1}\l(V^c\r)^c=f^{-1}\!\l(V\r)$ for all $V\subseteq Y$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
